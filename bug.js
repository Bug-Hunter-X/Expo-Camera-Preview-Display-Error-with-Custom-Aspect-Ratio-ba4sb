This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with custom camera controls and a specific aspect ratio.  When setting the `aspectRatio` prop of the `Camera` component to a non-standard value (e.g., {width: 16, height: 9}), the preview might display incorrectly or not at all, depending on device and Expo version. The preview might be stretched or cropped unexpectedly.  This is inconsistent and unpredictable across different devices.
